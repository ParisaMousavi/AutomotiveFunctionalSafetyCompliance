# Automotive Functional Safety Compliance

After I have written the "Automotive Functional Safety Cmpliance" E-Book of the intland. I gain for informatin about the functional safety compliance with ISO26262.

# Why we need functional safty in vehicles?

In vehicles we have the systems whose malfunction has the potential to lead to an unreasonable level of risk. Therefore the ISO 26262 should be used as the automotive standard for the functional safety case in electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems[1]. 


# What are the safety argument categories in ISO 26262

As ISO 26262 defines the dafety cases like the following items:



# Implicit safety argument in ISO 26262

** Hazardous evnt:** A hazardous event is the occurrence of a hazard in particular operational situation. Each haradous event is assigned an Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL).
The AUtomotive Safety Integrity Level has three levels:
1- Severity -> Extent of human hard.
2- Probability of exposure -> To operational situation.
3- Controllability -> Ability for persons at risk to take action to avoid harm.

To have a system which has compliance with the automotive standard ISO 26262 we shuold develop a failure mitigation mechanisms.
