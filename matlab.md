## Machine learning in Matlab

 - Training a network from scratch.
 - Using transfer learning to train on existing network.
 - Training an existing network to perform semantic segmentation.
**In this text we consider these logics for image classification.**

The neural networks which are available in Matlab are as following:

 - LeNet
 - GoogleNet
 - Tensorflow
 - Keras 

For using each of them only three four lines are neccessary.
