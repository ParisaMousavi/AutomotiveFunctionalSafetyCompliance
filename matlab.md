## Machine learning in Matlab

 - Training a network from scratch.
 - Using transfer learning to train on existing network.
 - Training an existing network to perform semantic segmentation.
**In this text we consider these logics for image classification.**

The neural networks which are available in Matlab are as following:

 - LeNet
 - GoogleNet (4)
 - Tensorflow
 - Keras 
 - Yolo 
 - SSD 
 - ResNet
 - AlexNet (1)
 - ResNet
 - VGG 16/19 (2,3)


For using each of them only three four lines are neccessary.

### Training a model from scratch

For developing a model we can use Convolutional neural network (CNN) and we can identify handwritting when a person write a digit.
The second thing that we need is the data, that e
