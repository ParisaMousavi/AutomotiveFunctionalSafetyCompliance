# About PID Controller

For small low torque motors with little or no gearing, one procedure you can use to get a good baseline tune is to probe its response to a disturbance.
For tuning a PID the following steps can be used:
1- Set all gains to zero.
2- Increase the P gain unit the response to a disturbance is steady oscillation.
3- Increase the D gain unit the oscillation go away 
4- Repeat st
